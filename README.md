**Installing and cloning manually**

Clone and configure the sample yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/langhamerm/StripeAPI.git
```

Create a .env file in the server folder and paste the following:

```
# Stripe API keys - see https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test

#Environment setup (web client)
STATIC_DIR=../../client/web

```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Stripe [developer dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) to find your API keys.

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

`STATIC_DIR` tells the server where the client files are located and does not need to be modified unless you move the server files.

**2. Follow the server instructions on how to run:**

Pick the server language you want and follow the instructions in the server folder README on how to run.

Run the following in your terminal:

```
cd server/node then run:

npm install
npm start

```
